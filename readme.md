# EFCoreApp

This repo contains a very simple Entity Framework Core 1.1 console application, created with Visual Studio 2015, to explore:

1. Creating the initial migration using "Code First" strategy.
2. Creating the initial database.
3. Basic connection string configuration.
4. Using configuration classes with Fluent API similar to EF 6's way.

Hope this helps someone.
